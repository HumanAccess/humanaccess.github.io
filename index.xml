      <description>My name&#39;s Phil, I left school in 1985 I took up the &#39;junior&#39; position at my father&#39;s typesetting firm, a decade later the internet arrived in our studio and immediately hooked I dived into learning how to build web pages.
I worked professionally as a web developer through until late 2010 when for a variety of reasons I drifted away from the industry. Whilst I always continued to poke around with building websites, for the next 5-6 years I didn&#39;t pay much attention to the evolution of web development.</description>
